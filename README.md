# Secure Hybrid Cloud Architecture with Azure Networking

# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure hybrid cloud architecture using Azure networking services. It includes:

Virtual Networks (VNets) with subnets for on-premises and cloud environments.

Site-to-Site VPN connectivity between on-premises and Azure networks.

Azure Firewall for centralized traffic control and security.

Private DNS Zone for seamless name resolution across hybrid environments.
Network security group (NSG) for granular control of traffic at subnet level

The project is documented in detail, including:

    -> 8-page documentation with explanations and configurations.

    -> Diagrammatic representation of the network flow.

    -> Step-by-step video for easy replication.
    
# Features
Hybrid Connectivity: Secure VPN connection between on-premises and Azure networks.

Traffic Control: Azure Firewall rules to allow/deny traffic based on source, destination, and protocols.

Name Resolution: Private DNS Zone for resolving domain names across hybrid environments.

Security: Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall for enforcing security policies.
